Creating individual blog posts in GitHub pages is easy. In this post I will show you the basics.

### How to easy post in GitHub Pages

Posts must be in the folder `_posts`and must have a special file format. 

### Naming the file

The format is the following:

```text
YYY-MM-DD-NAME-OF-POST.md
```

`YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers. The file can have the `.md` or `.markdown` extension.

### The file header

Add a header with the following values to the file:

```markdown
