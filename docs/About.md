This is a sample website that is served by GitHub pages. It is a sample for the book **Accelerate DevOps with GitHub** that explains how you can set up GitHub Pages with Jekyll to easily create and publish content in a nice way.

Note that anything on this website is markdown and lives in GitHub. That means it can be versioned and you can have pull requests to review and collaborate on changes.
